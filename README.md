## Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

Using semantic HTML.
Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.
