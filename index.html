            <p>2,400 trees are cut down each minute. By the time you finish reading this sentence, another three hectares of forest have been cut down. 25.8 million hectares of forest were lost in 2020, double the amount of forested land lost in 2001.At our current rate, all rainforests will be gone in 77 years.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, human impacts have already led to the loss of around 40% of the world’s forests. And we’re losing forests at a rate of 10 million hectares per year. Halting deforestation, protecting and sustainably managing forests, and restoring forests have never been more urgent.Forest degradation is a threat to ecosystems around the globe.</p>

                <h2>what are the Causes?</h2>
            <div class="p1">
                <p>The most common pressures causing deforestation and severe forest degradation are agriculture, unsustainable forest management, mining, infrastructure projects and increased fire incidence and intensity.
                </p>
                <p>Some infrastructure activities, such as road building, have a large indirect effect through opening up forests to settlers and agriculture. Poor forest management and unsustainable fuelwood collection degrade forests and often instigate a "death by a thousand cuts" form of deforestation.

            <h2>Why Should We Care?</h2>
            <div id="block4">
                
                <p>Forests are home to more than half of all species found on land, a rich variety of life that keeps many of our most vital natural systems running – from keeping our climate stable by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen, to regulating our water supply and improving its quality.</p>
                <p>Preserving tropical forests helps protect the millions of plant and animal species—many of which have been invaluable to human medicine—that are indigenous to tropical forests and in danger of extinction. Keeping forests intact also helps prevent floods and drought by regulating regional rainfall.</p>
